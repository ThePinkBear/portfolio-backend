Initially, I drove buses for nine years before being drafted into management, where I worked in traffic control, ensuring the delivery of public bus transportation in Stockholm for several years.\n\nFor a brief period, I worked in security, preceded by an equally brief apprenticeship in alarm installations. On and off, I have been involved in sales, accumulating over six years of experience in this field. Thanks to consistently high KPIs, I was promoted to store manager and successfully ran my own GameStop store.\nAdditionally, I managed to build and run my own caf√© between 2010 and 2011. Managing my own business was both challenging and rewarding.\n\nThese jobs consumed my twenties, and I found myself making lateral moves repeatedly without advancing in any notable career. Eventually, I realized the importance of education and self-improvement.\n\nIn my late teens, I completed my education at Komvux, where one of the courses I took was web development, which I immensely enjoyed. It combined my love for puzzles with creativity in a highly satisfactory manner. Despite receiving lots of praise from my instructors, there was no clear path forward, leading to a period of stagnation until a life re-evaluation in my early thirties.\n\nThe idea of coding and development resurfaced, and I decided to pursue it. After attempting to find a suitable learning path on my own, I discovered </salt> and their bootcamp approach to training up-and-coming developers. I applied, was accepted, and committed myself fully. In March 2022, I began the pre-course material, and by August of the same year, I emerged as a Full-Stack .Net Developer, feeling a sense of real accomplishment for the first time. However, my journey didn't stop there.\n\nIn the last week of the bootcamp, I was offered a position to join the instructors' guild at </salt>. I accepted the offer and served as a junior instructor for the next two bootcamps.\n\nMost recently, I spent nine months as one of </salt>'s consultants, placed with Dormakaba Scanbalt, where I developed integration solutions between their Locks and Doors API and customers' personnel applications." }
